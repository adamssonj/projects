#### These data structures were homework from a course in Algorithms and Data structures

* Binary tree
* Hash set
* Linked List
* Stack - with a postfix evaluator

The course introduced test driven programming so there are test classes for every data structure. But please not that most of the tests weren't authored by me, only parts of each.
